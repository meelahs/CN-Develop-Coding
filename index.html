    <h1>Organic Food</h1>
    <div class="text"></div>
      <p class="para1">
        Organic food refers to food products that are produced, prepared, and
        processed without the use of any chemicals. It means organic food
        production prohibits the use of chemical pesticides, chemical
        fertilizers, or chemical preservatives. Consequently, organic foods are
        increasingly gaining popularity because a greater portion of the
        population wants to know its benefits. The general public belief is that
        organic food is healthier compared to the conventional ones, and it’s
        the primary reason for its increased demand over the past decade.

        Better overall health: Because organic food is not produced or processed
        using chemical pesticides or chemical fertilizers, it does not contain
        any elements of toxic chemicals and may not affect human health in
        harmful ways. The use of natural techniques such as green manure to
        fertilize the lands and crop rotation in pest and disease control work
        well in producing safer, healthier, and aromatic final food products.
        Besides, healthy foodstuff simply means healthy people and better
        nourishment for a better living for both people and animals.

        Antioxidant content: The positive effects of antioxidants on overall
        health have been established in several scientific studies, especially
        those derived from organic foods. This is because organic foods are free
        of foreign chemicals that normally react with vitamins, organic
        compounds and minerals thus lowering the essential positive impacts of
        antioxidants in food products. The latest studies propose that the
        consumption of organic food can contribute to more intake of
        nutritionally advantageous antioxidants and limited exposure to heavy
        metals. The positive impacts of antioxidants obtained from organic foods
        include prevention of heart disease, cancer, vision problems, premature
        aging, and cognitive malfunction.

        Improved Heart condition: Exclusive grazing on natural grass increases
        the amounts of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid) found in animal products.
        The sun's energy is well taken in by natural grass through
        photosynthesis and is converted into the most desirable organic CLA by
        the herbivores that feed on it. CLA is a heart-healthy fatty acid with
        the potential of bolstering cardiovascular protection, and it is found
        in higher quantities in the meat and milk products of animals that have
        been pastured in the free-range.

        Antibiotic resistance: Humans are susceptible to various health issues
        and diseases, and most of the time they must take precautionary measures
        to ensure they remain healthy. This is achieved by getting a variety of
        vaccinations and antibiotic drugs when a new strain of virus or bacteria
        is realized. Similarly, non-organic food sources (especially livestock
        and feeds) use vaccines, growth hormones, animal by-products, and
        antibiotics to treat and feed the animals. When humans consume the
        non-organic food products, they indirectly consume the antibiotics,
        growth hormones and vaccines which weaken immune systems on the account
        of antibiotic, vaccine, hormones, and animal by-products overdose. This
        may alter the immune system thereby rendering humans unable to defend
        themselves against diseases. The benefit of organic foods is that their
        production processes does not involve the use of antibiotics, growth
        hormones, animal by-products, or vaccines.
