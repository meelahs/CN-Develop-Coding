            Stronger immune system: The industrial farming practices aim at enhancing production and farm output by all means necessary. For example, the notion of producing more cereals, more meat and bigger fruits through genetic modifications and use of growth hormones seems to solve some of the world’s food insecurity concerns. The effects are not yet visible, but in the long-term, the consequences are sensitivity to allergens and a major reduction in immune system strength.
            By eating organic foods, the risks of decline in immune system strength are significantly reduced because organic foods are not altered at all. Furthermore, organic foods have quality and higher vitamin and mineral contents that help to strengthen the human immune system.

            Better taste: Apart from nutrition, the mineral and sugar structures in
            organic foods are tasty because the crops are given more time to develop
            and mature. The use of natural and environmentally friendly agricultural
            production techniques is revealed to be the reason for the better taste
            in organic food products. It is commonly reported that the taste of
            organic vegetables and fruits are of higher quality compared to those
            that are conventionally grown.

            Pesticide cutback: Chemical pesticide consumption is linked to a variety
            of diseases and disorders namely cancers, digestive dysfunctions,
            headaches, ADHD, birth defects, weakened immune system, and even
            premature death. Organic foods are free of pesticides and that is why
            they are preferable for attaining a better overall health. As much as
            pesticides have the power of keeping certain pests away from the crops,
            they also have potent chemicals like organophosphorus. Organic food
            products, therefore, offer a better healthy living, especially for
            children who are potentially affected by the pesticide toxins during
            their developmental ages.

        Better overall health: Because organic food is not produced or processed using chemical pesticides or chemical fertilizers, it does not contain any elements of toxic chemicals and may not affect human health in harmful ways. The use of natural techniques such as green manure to fertilize the lands and crop rotation in pest and disease control work well in producing safer, healthier, and smellier final food products. Besides, healthy foodstuff simply means healthy people and better nourishment for a better living for both people and animals.
